Perfect.
I will now give you a **clear, repeatable, service-by-service audit framework** that you can use **exactly as you described**:

> You give **one service at a time** to an AI (or to me),
> and the AI can **verify whether that service is fully implemented, partially implemented, or wrong**.

This is **not theory**.
This is a **practical audit process + checklist** you can reuse for *every single service* in ShopSphere.

---

# 🧠 HOW THIS AUDIT WORKS (READ ONCE)

For **each microservice**, the audit will answer **only these questions**:

1. ❓ *Is this service doing ONLY what it should do?*
2. ❓ *Is anything missing that this service MUST have?*
3. ❓ *Is it depending on something it SHOULD NOT depend on?*
4. ❓ *Is the data flow correct (API vs Kafka)?*
5. ❓ *Is the database usage correct for this service?*
6. ❓ *Is it production-ready or only demo-ready?*

To do that consistently, we use the **same audit template for every service**.

---

# ✅ UNIVERSAL AUDIT TEMPLATE (USE THIS EVERY TIME)

If file need any changes create a github branch for auditing, make the changes, write test script and test it. Do not commit or push or merge until I say.

```

### 🔹 Output the AI must give you

```
1. Purpose correctness
2. Missing responsibilities
3. Wrong responsibilities
4. API completeness
5. Kafka usage correctness
6. Database correctness
7. Security gaps
8. Scalability gaps
9. DevOps readiness
10. Final verdict
```

# 🧩 NOW: SERVICE-BY-SERVICE AUDIT CHECKLISTS

(THIS IS WHAT YOU COMPARE YOUR CODE AGAINST)
Service dependencies are in dependency.txt file

Below, for **each service**, I list **EXACT things that MUST exist**.
If something is missing → **that service is incomplete**.

---

## 🔷 1. API-GATEWAY — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* JWT validation filter
* Call to **Auth-Service** for token verification
* Rate limiting using Redis
* Route configuration per service
* Global exception handler
* Request/response logging
* Correlation ID / trace ID

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Database connection
* Business logic
* Kafka producers/consumers

### COMMON MISTAKES

* Token validation logic inside gateway code
* Hardcoded service URLs
* No rate limiting

---

## 🔷 2. AUTH-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* User registration
* Login
* JWT + refresh tokens
* Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)

* Emits `user.created` event

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Address tables
* Profile fields
* Cart/order logic

### RED FLAGS

* Other services accessing auth DB
* Profile data stored here

---

## 🔷 3. USER-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Listener for `user.created`
* Profile CRUD APIs
* Address CRUD

* Profile created synchronously during signup
* Missing Kafka listener

---

## 🔷 4. CATALOG-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Product CRUD
* Variant handling
* Category hierarchy
* Emits `product.created`, `product.updated`
* Media URL integration (NOT file storage)

* Images stored locally

---

## 🔷 5. MEDIA-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* File upload API

* Pricing logic

---

## 🔷 6. INVENTORY-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Stock table
* Reservation table
* Redis locks
* Listens to `order.placed`
* Emits `inventory.reserved`, `inventory.released`

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Product details
* Order totals

### COMMON MISTAKE

* Inventory updated via REST instead of events

---

## 🔷 7. PRICING-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Price history
* Promotion rules
* Emits `price.updated`
* Listens to `product.updated`

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Product metadata
* Inventory logic

---

## 🔷 8. CART-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Redis as primary store
* Cart item add/remove
* Price refresh logic
* Emits `cart.updated`

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Checkout orchestration
* Payment logic

---

## 🔷 9. CHECKOUT-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST (VERY IMPORTANT)

### MUST HAVE

* Saga orchestration
* Compensation logic
* Checkout session persistence
* Emits `checkout.started`
* Consumes `payment.confirmed`

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Order DB tables
* Payment gateway logic

### RED FLAG

* Checkout directly writing orders

---

## 🔷 10. ORDER-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Order table
* Order status history
* Consumes inventory & payment events
* Emits order lifecycle events

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Cart logic
* Payment gateway calls

---

## 🔷 11. PAYMENT-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Payment intent
* Webhook handling
* Refund logic
* Emits `payment.confirmed`

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Order tables
* Inventory logic

---

## 🔷 12. SHIPPING-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Shipment creation
* Carrier API integration
* Tracking updates
* Emits `shipment.created`

---

## 🔷 13. NOTIFICATION-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

* Kafka consumers
* Email/SMS/Push adapters
* Template system
* MongoDB logs

### MUST NOT HAVE

* User authentication logic

---

## 🔷 14. REVIEW-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* Consume `order.delivered`
* Review CRUD
* Moderation flags

---

## 🔷 15. SEARCH-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

* Elasticsearch index
* Kafka consumer
* Search APIs

### MUST NOT HAVE

* Product DB writes

---

## 🔷 16. ANALYTICS-SERVICE — AUDIT CHECKLIST

* Kafka consumers for ALL events
* Event persistence

## 🔷 18. MONITORING — AUDIT CHECKLIST

### MUST HAVE

* /metrics endpoints

---

# 🧪 HOW YOU USE THIS PRACTICALLY (IMPORTANT)

### Step-by-step:

1. Pick **one service**
2. Copy its repo/folder
3. Paste it here and say:

   > “Audit my `cart-service` using ShopSphere checklist”
4. I will return:

   * Missing items
   * Wrong dependencies
   * Architectural violations
   * Production readiness score

---

# ✅ FINAL PROMISE

You can now:

* Audit **every service independently**
* Detect **hidden coupling**
* Find **missing Kafka flows**
* Ensure **true microservice purity**
* Avoid “it works locally” disasters
